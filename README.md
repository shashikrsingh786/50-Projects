# 50-Projects

# Mini Projects Collection

Welcome to my Mini Projects Collection! This repository is a compilation of 50 mini projects **(working on it as of now)** built using vanilla JavaScript. Each project is designed to showcase different aspects of JavaScript and provide hands-on experience in building small, functional applications.

## Introduction

In this repository, you will find a diverse range of mini projects that cover various **JavaScript concepts, including DOM manipulation, event handling, asynchronous programming**, and more. These projects are perfect for beginners who want to strengthen their JavaScript skills or for developers looking to explore new ideas and techniques.

Feel free to explore the projects and dive into the code. Each project has its own dedicated folder containing the necessary files.

Happy coding! If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out.
